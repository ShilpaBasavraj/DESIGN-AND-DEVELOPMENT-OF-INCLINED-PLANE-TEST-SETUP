Design and Development of Inclined Plane Test Setup
Focus: Potential Divider Design and Implementation

This repository contains the project work “Design and Development of Inclined Plane Test Setup”, carried out as part of the Bachelor of Engineering program in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology.

The project’s objective was to develop an automated Inclined Plane Test (IPT) setup to evaluate the tracking and erosion resistance of polymeric insulators under high-voltage stress, in compliance with IEC 60587 and ASTM D2303 standards.

My Contribution

I specifically worked on the design and implementation of the Potential Divider, which plays a critical role in accurate high-voltage measurement and monitoring.

Key highlights of my work:

Designed a 1000:1 Potential Divider to step down voltages up to several kilovolts to a measurable range.

Performed design calculations, simulation, and component selection to ensure precision and safety.

Fabricated and tested the divider for reliability, minimizing leakage currents and ensuring stable output.

Integrated the potential divider into the test panel for real-time measurement during insulator testing.

Outcome

The potential divider successfully enabled safe and accurate measurement of test voltages, contributing to the overall functionality of the automated IPT setup.# DESIGN-AND-DEVELOPMENT-OF-INCLINED-PLANE-TEST-SETUP
